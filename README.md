# Advent of Code 2019

25 scripts to complete the 25 challenges for the 2019 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) challenge. All code written by [Paige McKenzie](https://github.com/p-mckenzie).

While the challenge was live on December of 2019, this project was undertaken retroactively in November 2020, as a way to work on scripting skills.

### Usage
Generally, each script `dayx.py` will leverage a file `dayx.txt`, provided by the challenge website, and output the challenge result (typically a number for part one, and another number for part two, for each day).
